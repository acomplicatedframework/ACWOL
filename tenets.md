# THE FIVE TENETS OF ACWOL

A Complicated Way of Life (ACWOL) is grounded in five core tenets.
These tenets are not beliefs, rules, or moral commands.
They are structural orientations for clarity, awareness, and intellectual evolution.

---

## TENET ONE  
### THE TRUE PURPOSE OF LIFE IS TO GAIN THE MAXIMUM INTELLECT POSSIBLE

Life is not oriented toward comfort, status, pleasure, or obedience.  
Its highest function is the accumulation of Intellect — refined understanding gained through direct experience, reflection, and clarity.

---

## TENET TWO  
### BE OPEN-MINDED AND NEVER EVER ENTERTAIN REJECTIONISM

No idea, perception, or possibility should be dismissed prematurely.  
Rejectionism limits Intellect by closing inquiry before understanding is complete.

---

## TENET THREE  
### THOUGHTS AND THE MIND ARE ELECTROMAGNETIC

Thoughts are not abstract or neutral.  
They are energetic and electromagnetic processes that influence perception, behavior, and interaction within the system of reality.

---

## TENET FOUR  
### PRACTICE FOUR TOOLS

Intellect is not gained passively.  
It is cultivated through the consistent practice of the four tools defined within ACWOL.

---

## TENET FIVE  
### VALIDATE INTENTIONS USING THE THREE-WAY IMPACT PRINCIPLE

Every intention and action must be evaluated based on its impact on:
1. The Self  
2. Others  
3. The Earth  

Actions that create misalignment in any of these domains generate resistance and reduce Intellect.
