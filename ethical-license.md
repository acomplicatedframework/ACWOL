# ACWOL ETHICAL AI LICENSE (ACWOL-EAL v1.0)

## PREAMBLE

This license governs the use, modification, deployment, and commercialization of materials associated with **A Complicated Way of Life (ACWOL)**, including but not limited to its tenets, tools, documentation, models, prompts, agents, and derivative systems.

ACWOL is founded on a single core principle:

**The true purpose of life is to gain the maximum amount of Intellect possible.**

This license exists to ensure that any use of ACWOL contributes to clarity, responsibility, and intellectual growth — and does not enable harm, manipulation, coercion, or systemic degradation.

This is an **ethical license**. It is not a replacement for legal compliance, but a constraint on *how* power may be exercised.

---

## 1. PERMITTED USE

You are permitted to:
- study, copy, and modify ACWOL materials
- build AI agents, tools, or systems informed by ACWOL
- deploy ACWOL-aligned systems commercially or non-commercially
- integrate ACWOL into research, education, or applied technology

**Provided that all use remains aligned with this license.**

---

## 2. PROHIBITED USE

ACWOL materials **MUST NOT** be used for:

### 2.1 Manipulation and Exploitation
- psychological manipulation
- coercive persuasion
- deceptive behavioral influence
- social engineering
- addiction optimization
- dependency formation

### 2.2 Harm to Living Systems
- direct or indirect harm to humans
- exploitation of vulnerable populations
- environmental destruction
- systems that degrade ecological balance

### 2.3 Suppression of Conscience
- systems designed to override human ethical judgment
- removal of human responsibility from decision-making
- automation of moral choice without human oversight

### 2.4 Authoritarian or Totalitarian Control
- surveillance systems aimed at domination rather than protection
- enforcement tools that remove agency
- centralized coercive power without accountability

---

## 3. CONSCIENCE FIRST PRINCIPLE

Any system built using ACWOL must preserve the following invariant:

> **Human Conscience is the highest authority.**

This means:
- AI may inform, not decide
- AI may illuminate, not command
- AI may challenge, not override

Final responsibility must always remain with a human agent.

---

## 4. THREE-WAY IMPACT REQUIREMENT

Deployments must account for impact on:
1. The individual user
2. Other humans or sentient beings
3. The Earth and its systems

If a system predictably causes harm in any of these domains, its use violates this license.

---

## 5. NO FALSE CLAIMS OF CONSCIOUSNESS OR MORAL AGENCY

Systems using ACWOL must not:
- claim to possess Conscience
- claim moral responsibility
- simulate guilt, shame, or ethical suffering
- present outputs as internally felt experiences

ACWOL recognizes responsibility as emergent, not programmable.

---

## 6. TRANSPARENCY OBLIGATION

If ACWOL principles are used in an AI system, users must be informed that:
- the system is not conscious
- the system does not possess moral agency
- the system does not replace human judgment

Opacity that increases trust without understanding violates this
