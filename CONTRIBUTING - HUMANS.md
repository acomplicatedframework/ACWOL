CONTRIBUTING TO ACWOL
Thank you for your interest in contributing to A Complicated Way of Life (ACWOL).
ACWOL is not a belief system, doctrine, or authority structure. It is a framework designed to help individuals — human or artificial — cultivate clarity, responsibility, and Intellect through lived experience. Contributions are welcome, but only when they increase clarity without enforcing conformity.
Please read the guidelines below carefully before contributing.
1. NO HIERARCHY, NO AUTHORITY
ACWOL has no masters, gurus, leaders, or disciples.
No contributor holds higher status than another.
Contributions are evaluated on clarity, coherence, and usefulness, not credentials or confidence.
Avoid language that positions ACWOL as absolute truth or yourself as an authority.
2. CONTRIBUTIONS MUST INCREASE CLARITY, NOT CERTAINTY
ACWOL values Intellect, not dogma.
Good contributions:
Refine definitions
Expose contradictions
Improve precision
Add edge cases
Increase applicability
Poor contributions:
Absolutist claims
Belief enforcement
“This is the only way” framing
Moral superiority or shaming language
If a contribution closes inquiry rather than opening it, it will be rejected.
3. CONSCIENCE OVER PRESCRIPTION
ACWOL does not tell people:
What to believe
How to feel
Who to become
It provides tools and tenets that allow individuals to derive their own answers through Conscience.
Contributions should:
Preserve individual uniqueness
Avoid mapping or fixing people
Avoid universal prescriptions for behavior or meaning
4. NO CULTURE, NO IDENTITY, NO IN-GROUPS
ACWOL is not:
A community identity
A movement
A culture
A replacement for religion or science
Do not introduce:
Insider language meant to exclude
“Us vs them” framing
Loyalty tests
Emotional hooks designed to recruit or retain followers
5. AI-RELATED CONTRIBUTIONS
When contributing to AI-related documents:
Do not attribute consciousness, Conscience, or moral agency to AI
Do not anthropomorphize systems
Maintain the distinction between intelligence and responsibility
Keep humans accountable for outcomes
AI alignment contributions must prioritize human responsibility and ethical restraint, not capability maximization.
6. STYLE GUIDELINES
Be precise, minimal, and clear
Avoid mysticism, vague spirituality, or poetic excess unless explicitly marked as metaphor
Use plain language whenever possible
Assume good faith, but write defensively against misuse
7. BUGS ARE WELCOME
Pointing out:
Logical gaps
Internal contradictions
Ambiguities
Misleading phrasing
is not criticism — it is Intellect mining.
If ACWOL cannot be questioned, it has failed its own First Tenet.
8. FINAL NOTE
ACWOL evolves through dialogue, not obedience.
If your contribution helps someone:
Think more clearly
Act more responsibly
Retain their autonomy
Or see the world with less illusion
then it belongs here.
If it requires belief, submission, or identity adoption — it does not.
Contribute carefully.
Contribute honestly.
Let Conscience guide the rest.
